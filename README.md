## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Bio

ðŸ§¬ Since September 2024, I work as a Data Scientist at the [Green Life Sciences](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-science/research/clusters/green-life-sciences/green-life-sciences.html) research cluster of the University of Amsterdam. I'm here to contribute data science expertise to any GLS scientist with data related questions, ranging from high-volume -omics data to experimental design.

ðŸ¥¬ðŸ¦  Previously, I was also employed by the University of Amsterdam as a PhD candidate. In my PhD work, I studied molecular interactions between plants and a pathogenic bacterium, called *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *campestris*.
